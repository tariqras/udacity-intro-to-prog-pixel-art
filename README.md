# Pixel Art Maker Project

Forked Repository for Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree JavaScript Project

## Instructions

Clone the repo locally.  Switch to dev and branch from dev for changes.  Only functioning complete code may be merged with dev.

At some point I will clean up the sub-branches

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
